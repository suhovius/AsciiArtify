### Docker VS Podman

There exists `docker` alternative, - `podman`. Main advantages are free license as it is opensource and additional security as it does not require to run daemon process with root privileges.
While docker needs a daemon process to run. And docker commercial usage requires licensing. See more details [here](https://www.docker.com/pricing/)

After experiments with Podman a few issues were encountered:
* It can not be installed at Ubuntu Linux that runs at Github Codespaces. While at OSX laptop it can insalled easily along with Desktop App and CLI utility.
* In order to let it run with `k3d` for example it requires some hacking. `k3d` documentation warns that [Podman support is experimental](https://k3d.io/v5.4.1/usage/advanced/podman/)
* `kind` can't load podman images, needs some extraction into archive and still it does not work.
* All present kubernetes ecosystem mostly relies on Docker while Podman support is experimental.

### Kind + Podman

At my OSX laptop it was possible to create clusted via `kind` + `podman`. [Read more here](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/rootless/)
But still it warns that it is an experiamental feature:
```
KIND_EXPERIMENTAL_PROVIDER=podman kind create cluster --name kind-podman-test-cluster

```

### Minikube + Podman   

It also it warns that it is an experimental feature and moreover it got got some errors at startup.

### k3d + Podman at macOS
Experimental configuration is shown [here](https://k3d.io/v5.6.3/usage/advanced/podman/#macos)
It seem it is too much docker dependand, that it requires some hacking to substitute docker environemnt variables in order to get k3d working with podman.
At my local configuration I did not get it working at OSX.

```

```

So `podman` does not seem to be a good option for start-up project where speed of development matters and so infrastructure should be able to be maintained smoothly as well.

### Decision Graph
TBD (Provide options, decisions and conditions via draw.io)

### Recommended Tool
`k3d` is ligtweight solution with minimal set of core features that shoud be enough for MVP and PoC start-up project phases.
And later on in case of project success and growth it will be possible to migrate into full-fledged and heavy `k8s` solution.
